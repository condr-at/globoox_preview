    "text": "In 1872, Charles Darwin made a bold prediction in 'The Descent of Man.' He wrote that in the distant future, psychology would be based on a new foundation—the understanding that each mental power and capacity must be acquired through gradual evolution. Darwin believed that the human mind, like the human body, was a product of natural selection. This prediction proved remarkably prescient, though it took more than a century to gain widespread acceptance."

    "text": "The resistance to evolutionary explanations of the human psyche runs deep. Many people readily accept that humans evolved physically from earlier primates, but balk at the suggestion that our minds, emotions, and behaviors are also products of evolution. The idea that love, morality, creativity, and consciousness emerged through the same blind process that gave us opposable thumbs seems to diminish something essential about humanity. It feels like a threat to human dignity and free will."

    "text": "In 2007, the journal Nature published an editorial titled 'Evolution and the Brain' that addressed this ongoing resistance. The editorial noted that while evolution is now accepted as the organizing principle of biology, its application to human behavior and psychology still provokes fierce debate. Many scientists who fully accept evolution in other contexts become uncomfortable when it comes to explaining human nature. This discomfort has slowed progress in understanding the mind."

    "text": "The history of this resistance goes back to Darwin's own time. Alfred Russel Wallace, who independently discovered natural selection, initially supported Darwin's view that humans evolved entirely through natural processes. But later in life, Wallace retreated to a compromise position. He accepted that the human body evolved from apes, but insisted that humanity's 'higher' qualities—moral sense, abstract reasoning, artistic appreciation—could not have arisen through natural selection alone. These required divine intervention."

    "text": "Wallace's compromise proved enormously influential. It allowed people to accept human evolution while preserving the idea that humans are fundamentally different from animals in ways that matter most. This became the dominant view among educated people for much of the twentieth century. The body evolved, the story went, but the soul—or at least the uniquely human aspects of consciousness—came from somewhere else."

    "text": "Recent advances in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology have systematically undermined Wallace's compromise. Brain imaging studies show that there is no sharp line between 'animal' functions and 'higher' human functions—they all emerge from the same evolved neural mechanisms. Studies of animal cognition reveal that capacities once thought uniquely human—tool use, culture, empathy, even rudimentary morality—exist in other species. The supposed bright line between humans and animals has dissolved into a continuum."

    "text": "Yet resistance persists, sometimes in surprising places. In 2007, U.S. Senator Sam Brownback wrote an opinion piece arguing that while he had no problem with evolution explaining the development of the body, human consciousness and moral sense could not be reduced to natural processes. Brownback's position was essentially Wallace's compromise, repackaged for the twenty-first century. It showed how resilient this way of thinking remains, even among educated people."

    "text": "Nature's response to Brownback was unequivocal. The journal argued that compartmentalizing evolution—accepting it for bodies but not minds—is scientifically untenable. The brain is an organ like any other, shaped by natural selection to solve adaptive problems. Its complexity doesn't require special explanations beyond evolution. Trying to draw a line between physical and mental evolution is arbitrary and unhelpful."

    "text": "The search for the 'soul's edge'—the boundary where evolution stops and something else takes over—has been a recurring theme in debates about human nature. But every time someone draws such a boundary, further research erases it. Language, once thought to be a divine gift, turns out to have evolutionary precursors in animal communication. Morality, once thought to require divine commandments, emerges from evolved capacities for empathy and cooperation. Even consciousness, the final frontier, is yielding to naturalistic explanation."

    "text": "This book takes Darwin's prediction seriously. It assumes that the human psyche, in all its complexity and wonder, is a product of evolution. This doesn't diminish human nature—it explains it. Understanding how our minds evolved doesn't tell us what we are worth, but it does tell us what we are. And that understanding, difficult as it may be to accept, is the foundation for a truly scientific psychology."
