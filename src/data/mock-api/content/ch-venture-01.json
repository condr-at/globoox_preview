    "text": "In November 2012, the Qualcomm Ventures team gathered in their San Diego offices to evaluate a small startup that promised to revolutionize video conferencing. The company was called Saasbee, and on paper, it looked like dozens of other enterprise software pitches they reviewed each month. But something about this one caught the attention of Nagraj Kashyap, the managing director who had built a reputation for spotting diamonds in the rough."

Yuan had been corporate vice president of engineering at Cisco, overseeing the collaboration software division. Despite his success, Yuan had grown frustrated with WebEx's aging architecture and Cisco's bureaucratic innovation process. He believed video conferencing could be simpler, more reliable, and accessible on any device."
